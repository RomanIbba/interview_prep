## 1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.

You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:

Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.

Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2, and you should return 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109

## Solution JS ##

/**
 Time:
 - binary search = O(log(max(nums)))
 - isPossible = O(n)
 total = O(n * log(max(nums)))
 Space:
 total = O(1)
 */
var minimumSize = function(nums, maxOperations) {
    // Binary search bounds
        let left = 1; // Minimum possible size of a bag
        let right = Math.max(...nums); // Maximum possible size of a bag (initially the largest bag)

        // Binary search to find the optimal maximum bag size
        while (left < right) {
            const middle = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

            // Check if it is possible to achieve the target with the current middle value
            if (isPossible(middle, nums, maxOperations)) {
                right = middle; // Try smaller values (tighten the upper bound)
            } else {
                left = middle + 1; // Try larger values (tighten the lower bound)
            }
        }

        // Return the smallest possible value for the largest bag size
        return left;
};

function isPossible(maxBallsInBag, nums, maxOperations) {
        let totalOperations = 0;

        // Iterate through each bag in the array
        for (const num of nums) {
            // Calculate the number of operations needed to split this bag
            const operations = Math.ceil(num / maxBallsInBag) - 1;
            totalOperations += operations;

            // If total operations exceed the allowed maxOperations, return false
            if (totalOperations > maxOperations) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        // All splits can be achieved within the allowed operations, return true
        return true;
};
