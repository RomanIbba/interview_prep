## You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array queries.

There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. Initially, there is a unidirectional road from city i to city i + 1 for all 0 <= i < n - 1.

queries[i] = [ui, vi] represents the addition of a new unidirectional road from city ui to city vi. After each query, you need to find the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1.

Return an array answer where for each i in the range [0, queries.length - 1], answer[i] is the length of the shortest path from city 0 to city n - 1 after processing the first i + 1 queries.

 
Example 1:
Input: n = 5, queries = [[2,4],[0,2],[0,4]]
Output: [3,2,1]

Explanation:
![alt text](img/image8.jpg)
After the addition of the road from 2 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 3.
![alt text](img/image9.jpg)
After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 2.
![alt text](img/image10.jpg)
After the addition of the road from 0 to 4, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 4 is 1.

Example 2:
Input: n = 4, queries = [[0,3],[0,2]]
Output: [1,1]

Explanation:
![alt text](img/image11.jpg)
After the addition of the road from 0 to 3, the length of the shortest path from 0 to 3 is 1.
![alt text](img/image12.jpg)
After the addition of the road from 0 to 2, the length of the shortest path remains 1.

## Solution JS ##

/**
 Time: 
 - graph construction = O(n)
 - BFS for all ueries = O(q * n)
 - total time = O(q * n)

 Space:
 - adjacency list = O(n + q)
 - BFS storage = O(n)
 - results array = O(q)
 - total space = O(n + q)
 */
var shortestDistanceAfterQueries = function(n, queries) {
    // Initialize adjacency list
    const adj = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => [i + 1]);

    const shortestPath = () => {
        // Queue for BFS
        const queue = [[0, 0]]; // [node, length]
        const visited = new Set();
        visited.add(0);

        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const [current, length] = queue.shift();

            // If the target node is reached, return the path length
            if (current === n - 1) {
                return length;
            }
            // Explore neighbors
            for (const neighbor of adj[current]) {
                if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                    queue.push([neighbor, length + 1]);
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
    };
    const result = [];

    // Update adjacency list based on queries and calculate shortest path
    for (const [src, dst] of queries) {
        adj[src].push(dst);
        result.push(shortestPath());
    }
    return result;
